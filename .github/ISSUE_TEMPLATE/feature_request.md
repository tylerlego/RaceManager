## Description
_Give a description of what the feature should do, from the perspective of a user or site admin. If this cannot be done in two sentences, consider splitting the task into an even smaller chunk
i.e. As a user, I want to be able to access the site by logging in to my discord account._

## Value
_Give a value statement that describes what the benefit of developing this feature is.
i.e. By allowing a user to sign-in with Discord, they are able to access the core content of the site quicker, and with less hassle (no email sign up, account creation, etc). It also allows us to co-manage aspects of the team from both the app and server -- members on the server are the source of truth for who is a member of the team._ 

## Requirements
_List the requirements for this feature to be considered done. Note that this does not need to be an exhaustive list. 
i.e_
1. Users who are not signed-in will be directed to a login page whenever they try to access the site.
2. After clicking to login, the user will be shown a pop up asking them to authorize with discord.
3. After authorizing users will be directed to a success page.
